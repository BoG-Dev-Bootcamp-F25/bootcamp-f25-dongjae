            <p>I graduated from my bachelors in CS last year and I am currently on my last semester of my 1-Year Master in Computer Science specializing in machine learning.
                I am passionate about teaching and making education more accessible, which I've pursued as a Teaching Assistant for multiple semesters and through tutoring my peers.
                Helping others build their skills in computer science and understand something for the first time is something I enjoy a lot.
                Originally from NC, I have also traveled a lot during my time at Tech including Chicago, New York, Seattle, and Puerto Rico.
